Clone of Liero/Gusanos in html5

Here is a demo of an old version: http://kwejk.pk/shoot/?map=mars&webgl=true

Avaliable maps: blat, pyramid, poo, wtf

<h4>How to run current version:</h4>

Requires:
<ul>
<li>For example: WampServer</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Browser with html5 including WebWorkers, WebRTC and WebGL</li>
</ul>

Run it by url:
http://localhost/gus/?conntoid=host

Browser's console (not a gray one on website) will show you ID of host. You can use this id to open second tab and connect through p2p to first tab, but NetPlay is still crappy.

<h4>To Do:</h4>

- Object-Object Collisions
- NetPlay
